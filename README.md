# PNP
The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations are a set of partial differential equations used to describe the transport of ions in an electrolyte solution. They are commonly used to model ion channels, which are proteins that allow ions to pass through cell membranes. 

The PNP equations consist of three equations: The Poisson equation describes the electrostatic potential in the solution, while the Nernst-Planck equations describe the transport of cations and anions due to diffusion and electrostatic forces. 

The PNP equations are important in the study of ion channels, as they can be used to predict the current flowing through the channel as a function of the ion concentrations and the electrostatic potential. They are also used in the design and optimization of ion channels for various applications, such as drug delivery and biosensing. However, the PNP equations are computationally intensive and require numerical methods to solve, making them challenging to use in some applications.
